# Server Room Temperature Control and Monitoring System using Arduino Uno R4 WiFi


A smart system to monitor and control server room temperature using Arduino Uno R4 WiFi. This project automates cooling with a DC fan based on real-time temperature data from a DHT22 sensor, with cloud integration for remote monitoring.

## Features
-  Real-time temperature/humidity monitoring via DHT22
-  PWM-controlled 12V DC fan for precise cooling
-  Adjustable temperature threshold via potentiometer
-  Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard for remote access
-  Historical data logging
